A desktop application written in Python that is specialized for pharmacies to input medicine prescription. 
The prescription is then saved into a Google Firebase Real-time Database.

This software also automatically prints the prescription using a selected printer, 
and it also creates an eticket on what are the usages and how to consume the medicine. 
This eticket will be printed using a selected barcode or sticker printer.

It uses Tkinter GUI library to create the GUI and it incorporates multi-threading as well.
