An Android-based application coded using Kotlin that enables its user to search for a medicine through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database.

Before starting, the user will need to sign-up first. This sign-up details will then be saved in serverless JSON database. Then, the user can sign-in using 
the details that he/she just signed-up. If the credentials match with the one saved in the serverless JSON database, then, they are able to use the application.

To search for the medicines, there are a few categories that the user can choose from:
- Brand Name
- Usage
- Description
- Substance Name
- Consumption Way
- Manufacturer Name

Below are the screenshots from the application (using Samsung S20 FE device).
