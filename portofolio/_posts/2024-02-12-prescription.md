A desktop application written in Python that is specialized for pharmacies to input medicine prescription. 
The prescription is then saved into a SQLite database. It is also automatically printed using a printer, 
and it also creates an eticket on what are the usages and how to consume the medicine. This eticket will be 
printed using a barcode printer.

This software is written using Tkinter GUI and it incorporates multi-threading as well.
