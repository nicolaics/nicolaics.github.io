A desktop application written in Python that is specialized for pharmacies to input medicine prescription. 
The prescription is then saved into a Google [Firebase Real-time Database].

By using this software, you can search for medicines that exists already in an SQLite Database, or if it 
doesn't exist, it will automatically update the database. There is also a feature where you can set a 
prescription with a list of medicines, so that you won't need to add the medicine one-by-one.

By implementing [Firestore Database], this software checks for a duplicated prescription number in a day. 
This helps to prevent any duplicated prescription number when inputting.

This software also automatically prints the prescription using a selected printer, 
and it also creates an eticket on what are the usages and how to consume the medicine. 
This eticket will be printed using a selected barcode or sticker printer.

In order to reduce the workload of its main thread, this software incorporates multi-threading as well. 
When creating and printing the PDF, the software runs this tasks in another thread.

It uses Tkinter GUI library to create the GUI.

Below are the screenshots of the software.
